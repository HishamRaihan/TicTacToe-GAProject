# Hishams Tic Tac Toe Project

## The BackStory
- This project has allowed me to incorporate everything we have learned in this bootcamp up until now.
- I used HTML, SCSS, JS, JQuery and learned how to use curl scirpts along with AJAX.
- To me it was much more than a project - it was a big learning experience.
- If I missed anything hopefully it will be made up in my styling.
